## Devlog
The variables tracking seeds planted are listed under the UI section in the original written plan, but they are actually located in the Player object. These variables are called _numSeedsLeft for how many seeds the player can plant and _numSeedsPlanted for how many seeds the player has planted. The plant prefab is created by the Player script on the Player object, which checks _numSeedsLeft after the PlantSeed() function is called by the space bar being pressed. It then instantiates a plant prefab at the player's position. The Player script also calls the UpdateSeeds() function on the PlantCountUI script as part of the PlantSeed() function, and it uses _numSeedsLeft and _numSeedsPlanted as the arguments to change the text of the UI.

## Prof comments
Good job connecting your break-down to the code, especially describing something that you ended up changing. :)

Please consider formatting your break-down activities with the hyphen '-' symbol as suggested above, and remove the prompts. Also, make sure to put your break-downs in the correct section. This will make it a lot easier for me to read. See the [README formatting guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
